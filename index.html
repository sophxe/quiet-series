            <h2>Before the day</h2>
        <p>Before the day of the competition, you should check the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check that you have a valid <a href="https://www.britishpowerlifting.org/buy-membership">British Powerlifting</a> membership. You will need to bring this with you on the day</li>
            <li>Check the <a href="#">Lifting Schedule</a> so you know when you will be weighing in, and when your session starts</li>
            <li>Check you have all your equipment (singlet, deadlift socks, shoes, belt if used etc) and that it is to IPF specifications</li>
            <li>Familiarise yourself with the <a href="https://www.powerlifting.sport/fileadmin/ipf/data/rules/technical-rules/english/IPF_Technical_Rules_Book_2024_24_Jan.pdf">IPF rules</a>, as all your lifts will be judged to this standard</li>

            <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
            <p> All of our volunteers are very friendly and are there to ensure your competition experience runs as smoothly as possible. If you have any questions for them, don't hesitate to let one of the team know - we don't bite!</p>
            <h3>Referees and Technical Controller</h3>
            <p>Our referees and technical controller will be ensuring that all of your equipment meets competition
                specification, and will be analysing your lifts to ensure they meet the standards as set out within the

                    Rulebook</a>. They are a friendly bunch who are well versed in the rules. If for any
                reason you receive a red light from one of the referees, you or your hanlder can ask them to clarify why
                (do this as soon as you have lifted - there are a lot of lifters!). The Technical Controller will make
                sure that you're ready to go onto the platform.

            <p>Our platform crew will load the bar and act as spotters keep you safe in the event that you fail a lift.
                In this case, the centre spotter will be standing behind you and will use their arms to support you back
                up with the bar. If you'd like a run through on how this happens, or would like to see a demonstration,
                please feel free to ask the platform crew before lifting begins and they will be happy to demonstrate!

            <h3>Table Crew</h3>
            <p>The table crew are our data entry wizards, and will be ready to take your next attempt once you've
                completed a lift. Once you've completed your lift, go straight to the table and tell them your next
                attempt (or have your handler do this for you). You have 60 seconds from finishing your lift to enter a
                next attempt, so it's always good to have a rough idea of your aim before you start. If you don't give
                an attempt in, it will automatically increase by 2.5kg (or will stay the same as the previous lift in
                the event of a 'no-lift').</p>
