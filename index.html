        <p>To help prepare you for what to expect on the day, we have put together some information about the volunteers
            you will see on the day, and a brief description of their role. All of our volunteers are very friendly and
            are there to ensure your competition experience runs as smoothly as possible. If you have any questions for
            them, don't hesitate to let one of the team know - we don't bite!</p>

            <h2>Referees and Technical Controller</h2>
            <p>Our referees and technical controller will be ensuring that all of your equipment meets competition
                specification, and will be analysing your lifts to ensure they meet the standards as set out within the
                <a href="https://www.powerlifting.sport/fileadmin/ipf/data/rules/technical-rules/english/IPF_Technical_Rules_Book_2024_24_Jan.pdf">IPF Rulebook</a>. They are a friendly bunch who are well versed in the rules. If for any
                reason you receive a red light from one of the referees, you or your hanlder can ask them to clarify why
                (do this as soon as you have lifted - there are a lot of lifters!). The Technical Controller will make sure that you're ready to go onto the platform.</p>

            <h2>Platform Crew</h2>
            <p>Our platform crew will load the bar and act as spotters keep you safe in the event that you fail a lift. In this case, the centre spotter will be standing behind you and will use their arms to support you back up with the bar. If you'd like a run through on how this happens, or would like to see a demonstration, please feel free to ask the platform crew before lifting begins and they will be happy to demonstrate!</p>

            <h2>Table Crew</h2>
            <p>The table crew are our data entry wizards, and will be ready to take your next attempt once you've completed a lift. Once you've completed your lift, go straight to the table and tell them your next attempt (or have your handler do this for you). You have 60 seconds from finishing your lift to enter a next attempt, so it's always good to have a rough idea of your aim before you start. If you don't give an attempt in, it will automatically increase by 2.5kg (or will stay the same as the previous lift in the event of a 'no-lift').</p>
